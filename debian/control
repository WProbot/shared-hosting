Description: Framework for easy management of shared hosting accounts.
 This package facilitates the management and hosting of sites under multiple
 separate accounts. Each hosting account uses its own instance of PHP-FPM that
 is sandboxed to its home directory for extra security. Out of band management
 is made possible with the use of bindfs to override group permissions in each
 hosting account's home directory. Free TLS certificates can be enabled for each
 site with the help of Let's Encrypt.
